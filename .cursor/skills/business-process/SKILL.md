# /business-process
**Target Paths:** `[Target Path]/Common/Business processes`
**Guidelines:** Use standard MD + Mermaid `flowchart` or `sequenceDiagram`. Model the process by business actions on surfaces, not by repo/service topology.

## Process meaning
- Start from the business question: who is doing what on which surface/channel.
- Show handoffs, decisions, exceptions, and outcomes.
- A process can touch multiple surfaces or modules, but the primary lens is business action, not technical boundary.
- Use `sequenceDiagram` when interactions between actors/surfaces matter; use `flowchart` when decision paths matter more.
- **MANDATORY ERROR FLOWS IN DIAGRAMS:** When generating Mermaid `flowchart` or `sequenceDiagram`, Agent MUST explicitly model error paths and exception handling. This includes:
  - Global error redirects (e.g., 401 Unauthorized redirect to login, 403 IDOR blocking).
  - Validation failures (422) returning to the form state.
  - Conflict exceptions (409) and their UI resolutions.
- Do not describe the process as a service map unless the service boundary is the actual business concern.

## Modifiers (If /legacy is used)
Khi gọi kèm `/legacy` (vd: `/legacy /business-process`):
- Tham chiếu source từ `legacy-repos.local.json`.
- Khảo cổ: truy vết flow nghiệp vụ từ hệ thống cũ để ánh xạ thành các luồng `FLOW-*` tương ứng theo actor / surface / action / outcome. Đưa vào cùng thư mục đang thao tác nhưng tên file thêm tiền tố `legacy-` ở đầu (vd: `legacy-process.md`).
